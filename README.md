## Project Overview

The primary objective of this project is to analyze and visualize the data related to water purifiers. To begin with, I identified the problem statement, which revolves around understanding various aspects of water purifiers, such as brand performance, price ranges, and other significant attributes that impact consumer decisions. I carefully noted down the key attributes required for the analysis and outlined the entire process of data collection. I researched multiple sources, exploring online platforms and company websites to gather relevant and accurate data, ensuring that it would provide meaningful insights.

After collecting the raw data, I arranged it in a structured format using Excel. This involved organizing the various attributes, such as company names, prices, water purification technologies, and features. Once the data was organized, I moved on to data cleaning. Data cleaning is essential to eliminate any errors or inconsistencies, such as duplicates, missing values, or incorrect entries. After thoroughly cleaning the dataset, I was left with a well-organized and structured Excel file, ready for analysis.

Next, I imported the cleaned data into Power BI, a powerful data visualization software. Power BI allowed me to explore the data more effectively by transforming raw numbers into interactive visuals. I used this software to visualize key areas of interest, such as the distribution of water purifiers across price ranges, comparisons between different brands, and trends in customer preferences. The visualizations helped reveal significant patterns that were not immediately apparent in the raw data.

To enhance the analysis further, I added various measures and calculated fields within Power BI. These additional metrics allowed me to dive deeper into the data, exploring insights like average price by brand, the correlation between price and features, and other factors influencing consumer choices. These calculated measures made it easier to draw actionable conclusions from the data.

The final step in the project was to create a comprehensive dashboard in Power BI. Building the dashboard required attention to detail, as it had to tell the full story of the water purifier market through visual representations. I carefully selected a background that complemented the theme of the project and arranged the visualizations in a way that was easy to follow. The dashboard brought together all the insights, displaying them in a simple yet informative way, allowing users to quickly grasp the important findings.
